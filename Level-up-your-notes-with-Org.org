Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects and
authoring documents with a fast and effective plain text system. --

* Getting started with Spacemacs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7c5bc67e-ec60-4085-b5e9-9d1a4b061188
:END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Spacemacs is a "community-driven Emacs distribution".

"The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!".

-- spacemacs.org
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I think spacemacs is the easiest way to get started
#+END_NOTES

** Why Spacemacs?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f3c82fbc-1bb6-456a-bfed-8fcc04dd8449
:END:

- As a *vim* user I can easily use Emacs.
- Managing configs is much easier.
- *You* don't have to use vim key bindings.

** Backup
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4ef15512-a4c1-4ef8-b148-b8d5a5a4b102
:END:

First backup your existing Emacs config if you have one.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mkdir ~/emacs_backup
  mv ~/init.el ~/emacs_backup/
  mv .emacs.d ~/emacs_backup/
#+END_SRC

** Install
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2dba716c-e2c1-44b9-84da-ca66dec2a3c0
:END:

Then install spacemacs (I assume you already have Emacs installed).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

* Configuring Spacemacs for Org

:END:

- Generate one with defaults

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <SPC> : dotspacemacs/install RET
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- To open the installed dotfile:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

*Note:* The =.spacemacs= used for this presentation is documented at the end of
 the presentation. You may want to refer to the tangled [[./dot-spacemacs][=dot-spacemacs=]].

** Enable org layer
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       24b385cb-7a6c-44cc-ab67-acf0f516461f
:END:

Enable the =org= layer in =dotspacemacs/layers=.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
    "Configuration Layers declaration.

  values."

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
After editing the config, close and restart Emacs to install the layer.

** Agenda files
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       918f19f2-dd9d-4792-9575-42123a17d3a3
:END:

*TODO* items, *time-stamped* items, and *tagged headlines* can be scattered
throughout a file or even a number of files. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Agenda-Views.html#Agenda-Views][Agenda views]] allow Org to select
entries based on various criteria for display in a separate buffer.

Tell org where you keep your notes. Make sure this presentation is included!

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    ;; Set the org-agenda files
    ;; Subdirectories must be explicitly specified.
    (setq org-agenda-files
      '("~/org" "~/src/presentations/Level-up-your-notes-with-Org"))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
  The agenda is neat, though I admit I have not trained myself to live in it yet.
  It allows you to search and display items throughout your org files. You can
  even interact with things directly from agenda views.

  - an agenda that is like a calendar and shows information for specific dates
  - a TODO list that covers all unfinished action items,
  - a match view, showings headlines based on the tags, properties, and TODO
    state associated with them,
  - a timeline view that shows all events in a single Org file, in time-sorted
    view,
  - a text search view that shows all entries from multiple files that contain
    specified keywords,
  - a stuck projects view showing projects that currently don’t move along, and
  - custom views that are special searches and combinations of different views.

* Using Org mode in Spacemacs
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b6cc044c-384f-4cde-8de8-991f1232e135
:END:
** Make a new entry
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7d103e08-0d1f-40e3-8157-924cc5437660
:END:

- An entry is a line starting with one or more =*=
- Insert a new headline after the current one by typing =<comma> h i=

** Capture a new TODO (or other standard type of entry)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d686855a-e312-45e8-b9ce-7019020079fc
:END:

Capture templates make capturing new entries quick and easy.

*Note:* The configuration used for this presentation allows you to capture a new
TODO by typing =<comma> c t=.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I have played with various capture templates for meeting notes, todos and other
kinds of tasks. Except for TODOs none of the other capture templates I have
tried have stuck for me, but I keep experimenting.
#+END_NOTES

** Tag entries for search                                           :findme:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       86a5ba5e-437a-4ee8-b85b-a7722dd84ca8
:END:

You can tag headlines so that they are easy to find later. With the insertion
point on a header type =<comma> := to tag the entry.

- Separate tags with =:=
- Spaces aren't allowed

** Agenda views
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ca5424ad-4560-4d4b-a0cb-8ae8081574e8
:END:

From an org file:
- =<comma> a=

From anywhere in Spacemacs:
- =SPC a o o=

** Searching for entries

** CLI Tools
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       14a6a197-fd02-4ef7-b44d-c161f7828513
:END:

Since this is all just plain text, you can use your favorite command line
utilities like [[http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/][=ag=]], [[http://beyondgrep.com][=ack=]] or =grep=.

** Agenda Searches
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       987a1069-b64c-4dfd-bd8b-5ee7666fa6db
:END:

- Search for entries tagged with =findme=

  From within an org file type =<comma> a m= and type findme.
** Stay focused
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       64e115d7-2237-4d4a-81a3-22a242fb936e

* Org Markup
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4a24bcf1-9ed3-4e34-9454-f64d624fe3e5
:END:

Org has its own markup syntax which is *really* beneficial for exporting.

- Markup your text. You will thank me later.
- This is *key to getting compliments*.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Really, spend the time to mark up the text.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= and ~code~, and,
  if you must, '+strike-through+'. Text in the code and verbatim string is not

#+END_SRC

You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= and ~code~, and,
if you must, '+strike-through+'. Text in the code and verbatim string is not
processed for Org mode specific syntax, it is exported verbatim.

*Note:* If you can't remember the markup you can access these formatting options
by typing =<comma> x=. Try doing this after highlighting a word.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
=verbatim= and ~code~ are especially useful for technical notes that include
commands.

The default html export is not bad, but to really wow people with html exported
versions of your notes check out [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][org-html-themes]].

I made this whole presentation in org-mode and I used the =ox-reveal= package to
export it. This allows me to version my presentations like any other plain text
source.
** Narrow before exporting

Narrowing before exporting can be useful so you share only a subset of notes.

I consider myself quite unorganized. At least inside my head it feels that way.

specifies each of your org files, or the directories to be searched for org

Some things in my notes need to be kept secret. This allows me to tag entries
with =crypt= to have them encrypted with my gpg key.

  ;; http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2011/02/keeping-your-secrets-secret.html
  ;; This allows me to encrypt subtrees that are tagged with crypt automatically.
  ;; by default I want to encrypt it to myself. but with properties entries I cna encrypt to other people. which is useful in a shared file situation
  (require 'org-crypt)

  ;; Automatically re-encrypt entries on save to avoid leaking decrypted
  ;; information.
  (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
  (setq org-crypt-disable-auto-save (quote encrypt))

  ;; GPG key to use for encryption
  ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.
  (setq org-crypt-key "5D1CCC11")

  ;; This prevents the crypt tag from being included in inheritance.
  (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))

And finally require some of the additional packages that I use.

  (require 'ox-reveal)

And finally, we reach the end.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle dot-spacemacs

;; End dotspacemacs/user-config
